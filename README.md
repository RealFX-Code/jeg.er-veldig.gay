## Contributing

Simple really, Fork this repo, Commit to your proposed changes, And create a Pull Request.

[Here's how to do that](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github)

### Building

Just like any other web app using vite..

```bash
# Open a development server ( with live code changes )

# Install npm packages
$ npm i

# run dev server
$ npm run dev

```
To build your site:

```bash
# To make a prod build:

# Install npm packages
$ npm i

# Build site
$ npm run build

# OPTIONAL: host built site ( not prod-ready )
$ npm run preview

```

#### Astro specific stuff

Since this site is built using astro, you can do cool stuff like use the astro cli to get to the astro documentation using:

```bash
$ npm run astro docs
```
### Can I write articles?

Well of course you can, but you have to not have any article slugs, author names, or titles that conflict with any pre-existing articles.

And articles **have** to be written in norwegian. This is intended to be a norwegian site, and so the articles will be in norwegian.

## Why this exact domain

I bought the domain: `er-veldig.gay` for e-mails, and though it'd be dumb to only have e-mail on it, so why not put something slightly useful to about 6 people on the domain. And from that on I decided to write this help-resource esque thing.
